          <h4>PROCESS MINING: Getting Started</h4>
            <p>In business process automation, organizations are primarily targeting on improving the process, so often they have little interest in exploring how the process is currently being performed in their organization.</p> 
            <p> 
              But understanding the current process is critical to detect:<br>
                 * Whether it is worth investing in further improvements.<br>     
                 * Where performance problems exist.<br>
                 * Process variations across the organization.<br></p>
                
                 <p>Whatever the nature of the process , as soon as it is supported by digital tools, information is created and stored by the corresponding IT systems (ERP, business applications, etc.), in particular via application logs. This stored information often has similarities and makes it possible to trace the path of an “object” through different stages at different times in time.
                 Process Mining is based on tools that use these digital footprints to reconstruct, visualize and analyze processes, thus providing transparency and objectivity towards the real process.<br>

            </p>
              <p>But many companies tend to either skip process mining altogether or adopt shortcuts to do it by paying consultants a lot of money to analyze the process.</p>
               <p>
                How to implement process mining in your organization: <br>

               <br>
                  
               Are you simply interested in process discovery and see how is your business functioning? 
               Would you like to enhance your processes and improve the throughput times? 
               Or do you simply want to monitor whether everything is running as smoothly as possible?<br>
               Answering these questions should be a priority!
                <br></p>

                <p>Required data:<br>
                If you are reading this and you are responsible for BI at your company chances are you already have access to some data.<br>
In order to be usable, these digital footprints must at least include:<br>
• Object: an instance that will be followed throughout the process, with a unique identifier. The choice of this object influences the scope of the studied process<br>
• Activity: a step in the studied process. The choice of activities influences the granularity of the process<br>
• Date: determines the order of activities and timing<br>
In addition, it may be interesting to collect additional data depending on the process, for example: supplier, type of product, location, person/management, channel, value…. These will allow further investigation.<br></p>


<p>Eventually, each process mining team should have people in these roles:<br>

                •	Executive Sponsor - To champion the project and secure buy-in and budget from senior decision-makers<br>
                •	Data Analysts - To interpret the business impact of the findings surfaced during the Discovery stage<br>
                •	Business Users (i.e., Practitioners and Team Leads) To guide use cases and improvement opportunities<br>
                •	IT Partners/Data Engineers - To authorize, facilitate and maintain the required technical integrations<br></p>
                
                <p>Key success factors:<br>
In order to obtain good results, the launch of a Process Mining initiative requires some precautions.<br>
 It can be noted that it is important:<br>
 • To identify from the outset the added value objective: cost reduction, improvement of the user/customer experience.<br>
 • To define a well-defined study scope in terms of process.<br>
 • To operate iteratively with short cycle analyses, within a fixed total time limit.<br>
 • To ensure the quality of the data on which the study is based. To do this, it is essential to collaborate with the IT experts of the systems used as well as the business experts of the processes studied.<br>
 • To accompany the change in case of redefinition of a target process.<br>
Moreover, the analyses carried out by Process Mining should not be an end in itself but should serve as a factual starting point for further process studies. Reintroducing a human aspect, for example by using a Design Thinking approach, makes it possible to deepen the results obtained thanks to Process Mining by taking the end users into account.<br>
