          <h4>PROCESS MINING: WHAT AND WHY</h4>
            <p>In recent years process mining has emerged as a new and important discipline in academic research as well as a promising data-driven technology in the Business Process Management (BPM) marketplace. <br> Process mining aims to discover, monitor and improve real business processes by extracting knowledge from event logs readily available in todayâ€™s enterprise information systems [Van Der Aalst, 2020].</p> 
            <p> 
              There are two main drivers for the growing interest in process mining:<br>
                 * The first is the explosion in the amount of event log process data generated by information systems such as ERP, WFM, CRM, SCM and PDM softwares.   <br>     
                 * The second is the pressing need to support and improve processes and hence business outcomes (by, among others, process automation) often in a context of complexity and confusion as to the de-facto state of actual processes (Ven Dar Aalst, 2020).
            </p>
              <p>Traditional process mapping and modeling approaches generally rely on interviews, observations and other subjective sources of data and are often costly and time-consuming [Anne Rozinat et al, 2014].<br> In addition and depending on dynamics and complexity of interdependencies, traditional approaches often fail to capture process data at high granularity and at low levels leaving business decision-makers unaware about how real processes actually work. [Anne Rozinat, et al, 2014]. <br> This  is particularly the case since in reality processes are constantly evolving, and, actual, de-facto processes often diverge from manuals and documented process descriptions (Van Der Aalst, 2010).</p>
               <p>
                Process mining can offer significant advantages as it: <br>
                  a) relies on objective, verifiable and hard data,<br>
                  b) enables quick and in real-time discovery of processes including improvement and automation levers, <br>
                  c) lowers the cost of implementation, <br>
                  d) allows ongoing discovery and monitoring of processes which enables iterative improvement and continuous assessment of processes (Lars Reinkemeyer, 2020).<br>
               </p>   
              <p>While process mining carries significant promise, there are significant roadblocks in the way of greater/accelerated adoption of process mining as a tool for business process innovation and digital transformation. While there has been a marked shift toward adoption of process mining in European Union and North America, many businesses in emerging market economies are yet to recognize the value of process mining (Shirin Dagher, 2020). <br> We argue that an asymmetry of information on the part of business decision-makers viz-a-viz the process mining marketplace is an important impediment in the way of greater/accelerated adoption of process mining. Even in EU and North America, managers often fail to understand and appreciate the potential and value of process mining as opposed to traditional process mapping and modeling approaches (Travis Bristow, 2019).</p>
